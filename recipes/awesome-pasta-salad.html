<h2>Description</h2>

<p> 
    Pasta salad is a refreshing and versatile dish that combines cooked pasta with an array of colorful vegetables, 
    flavorful herbs, and a tangy dressing. It offers a delightful medley of textures and tastes, making it a popular 
    choice for picnics, potlucks, and summer gatherings. The base of the salad typically consists of cooked pasta, 
    such as rotini or fusilli, which is then tossed with a variety of fresh vegetables like cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, 
    bell peppers, and red onions. Additional ingredients such as olives, feta cheese, and diced meats like ham or grilled 
    chicken can be added for extra flavor and protein. The dressing, often a zesty vinaigrette or creamy mayo-based mixture, 
    brings all the ingredients together, imparting a tangy and savory note. The salad can be customized to individual preferences,
    allowing for endless variations and personal touches. Whether served as a side dish or a light main course, pasta salad offers 
    a delightful harmony of textures, flavors, and colors that is both satisfying and refreshing.
